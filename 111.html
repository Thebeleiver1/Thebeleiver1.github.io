        <p>Lorem ipsumâ€¦ kjhkjhjkhkjhkjkhjkhhis page contains HTML code for coloring an element black. Typically, you might be changing the color of text or the background color of that text or another element. But you can also use HTML color codes to change the color of an element's border.

                Black Text
                One way of setting black text is by using the HTML <p> tag along with the style attribute. This is called inline styles.
                
                However, depending on how much text you need to color, you could apply the styles against a <div> tag (for all text within that element) or even the <body> tag (for all text on the page).</p>
