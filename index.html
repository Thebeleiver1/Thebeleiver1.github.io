                At its heart, HTML is a fairly simple language made up of elements, 
                which can be applied to pieces of text to give them different meaning 
                in a document (is it a paragraph? is it a bulleted list? is it part of 
                a table?), structure a document into logical sections (does it have a
                 header? three columns of content? a navigation menu?) and embed content
                  such as images and videos into a page. This module will introduce the first 
                  two of these, and introduce fundamental concepts and syntax you need 
                  to know to understand HTML.
