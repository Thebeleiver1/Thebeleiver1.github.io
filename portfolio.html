                        Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications.
                        With Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and JavaScript, it forms a triad of cornerstone technologies for
                        the World Wide Web.[4] Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage
                        and render them into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically
                        and originally included cues for the appearance of the document. HTML elements are the building blocks
                        of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects, such as interactive forms, may be
                        embedded into the rendered page. It provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural
                        semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. HTML elements
                        are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as
                        <img /> and
                        <input /> introduce content into the page directly. Others such as
                        <p>...</p> surround and provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements.
                        Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page.

                    In software engineering, a software development process is the process of dividing software development work into distinct
                    phases to improve design, product management, and project management. It is also known as a software
                    development life cycle. The methodology may include the pre-definition of specific deliverables and artifacts
                    that are created and completed by a project team to develop or maintain an application.[1] Most modern
                    development processes can be vaguely described as agile. Other methodologies include waterfall, prototyping,
                    iterative and incremental development, spiral development, rapid application development, and extreme
                    programming. Some people consider a life-cycle "model" a more general term for a category of methodologies
                    and a software development "process" a more specific term to refer to a specific process chosen by a
                    specific organization. For example, there are many specific software development processes that fit the
                    spiral life-cycle model. The field is often considered a subset of the systems development life cycle

                    History The software development methodology (also known as SDM) framework didn't emerge until the 1960s.
                    According to Elliott (2004) the systems development life cycle (SDLC) can be considered to be the oldest
                    formalized methodology framework for building information systems. The main idea of the SDLC has been
                    "to pursue the development of information systems in a very deliberate, structured and methodical way,
                    requiring each stage of the life cycle––from inception of the idea to delivery of the final system––to
                    be carried out rigidly and sequentially"[2] within the context of the framework being applied. The main
                    target of this methodology framework in the 1960s was "to develop large scale functional business systems
                    in an age of large scale business conglomerates. Information systems activities revolved around heavy
                    data processing and number crunching routines".[2] Methodologies, processes, and frameworks range from
                    specific proscriptive steps that can be used directly by an organization in day-to-day work, to flexible
                    frameworks that an organization uses to generate a custom set of steps tailored to the needs of a specific
                    project or group. In some cases a "sponsor" or "maintenance" organization distributes an official set
                    of documents that describe the process. Specific examples include: 1970s Structured programming since
                    1969 Cap Gemini SDM, originally from PANDATA, the first English translation was published in 1974. SDM
                    stands for System Development Methodology 1980s Structured systems analysis and design method (SSADM)
                    from 1980 onwards Information Requirement Analysis/Soft systems methodology 1990s Object-oriented programming
                    (OOP) developed in the early 1960s, and became a dominant programming approach during the mid-1990s Rapid
                    application development (RAD), since 1991 Dynamic systems development method (DSDM), since 1994 Scrum,
                    since 1995 Team software process, since 1998 Rational Unified Process (RUP), maintained by IBM since
                    1998 Extreme programming, since 1999 2000s Agile Unified Process (AUP) maintained since 2005 by Scott
